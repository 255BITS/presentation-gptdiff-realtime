# gptdiff-js examples

Runnable, self-contained example apps built on **[gptdiff-js](https://github.com/255BITS/gptdiff-js)**:
**generate a unified diff and smartapply it**, entirely in the browser, powered by
[NanoGPT](https://nano-gpt.com/r/mgzwtqjw). No server, no build, no install.

## `index.html` — diff → smartapply

The original demo: one self-contained file that uses gptdiff-js (loaded from `esm.sh`) with
NanoGPT's `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5-pro-ultraspeed`, streaming progress (live tokens + USD cost) as it works.

```
index.html ──▶ NanoGPT  (auth, diff, apply — all from the browser)
```

## Use it

Open the page, authenticate one of two ways, then edit the file + goal and hit **Diff & apply**:

- **Sign in with NanoGPT** — browser OAuth (PKCE). Requires the page be served over http
  (loopback) or https, since OAuth redirects there. The key is stored in `localStorage`.
- **paste key** — paste a key from [nano-gpt.com](https://nano-gpt.com/r/mgzwtqjw) → Settings → API. Works even when
  the file is opened directly (`file://`).

### Serve it locally (for OAuth)

```bash
npx serve .      # then open the printed http://localhost:3000
```

Use the `localhost` URL (the page auto-switches `127.0.0.1` → `localhost` to match NanoGPT's
loopback handling). Opening via `file://` works too, but only with the **paste key** option.

### Deploy it

It's a static file — drop it on any HTTPS host and OAuth works cleanly (no loopback quirks):

```bash
npx netlify deploy --prod --dir .     # or Cloudflare Pages / Vercel / GitHub Pages / Surge
```

## How it works

- **Auth** — browser PKCE: registers a client, redirects to NanoGPT consent, exchanges the
  code for a key (all NanoGPT auth endpoints are CORS-open). Key cached in `localStorage`.
- **Diff → apply** — `generateDiff(buildEnvironment(files), goal)` then `smartapply(diff, files)`,
  with a streaming `callLlm` injected so the diff/file build up live and exact token/cost
  figures come from NanoGPT's `x_nanogpt_pricing`.
- A no-op (empty/unparseable diff, or unchanged result) is shown explicitly, not silently.

## Realtime video overlay (`overlay.html`)

A second demo that shows gptdiff editing a **multi-file project**: a broadcast/stream
overlay built from SVG layers + a [GSAP](https://gsap.com) timeline + a JSON config + the
preview that stitches them together. Describe a change in the **Goal** box and gptdiff
rewrites *all* of them — **adding or removing files** as needed — and the looping preview
re-renders live (opening → middle hold → closing, on repeat).

There is **no real filesystem**. The "project" is an in-memory `{ path: content }` map (a
virtual FS) held in the page. `smartapply` returns a fresh map; the harness diffs it against
the current one (added / removed / changed) and swaps the result into the DOM by rebuilding a
single sandboxed `<iframe srcdoc>`. A tiny **mini-bundler** inlines every file into that one
document:

- `<!-- include-config: config.json -->` → `<script>window.OVERLAY_CONFIG = {…}</script>`
- `<!-- include: layers/foo.svg -->` → the raw SVG markup (so GSAP can animate its shapes)
- local `<script src="overlay.js">` → inlined; the GSAP CDN `<script>` is left untouched

So it stays a plain static HTML file — open it directly (`file://`) or serve it; nothing is
ever written to disk.

**Export bundle** runs the same bundler and downloads `overlay-bundle.html`: one self-contained,
transparent 1920×1080 file you can drop into an OBS *Browser Source*, screen-record, or hand to
a video editor.

The seed project lives in `overlay/` (`preview.html`, `overlay.js`, `config.json`,
`layers/*.svg`). When served, `overlay.html` fetches those files; opened via `file://` it falls
back to an identical copy embedded in the page.

```bash
npx serve .      # then open http://localhost:3000/overlay.html
```

## 3d object studio (`object3d.html`)

A multi-file project that renders in **3D**: gptdiff edits the geometry (`object.js`), the
material (`material.js`), an SVG `texture.svg`, the lighting/animation (`effects.js`) and a
`scene.json` config; the preview on the right rebuilds the object live with [Three.js](https://threejs.org)
and **OrbitControls** (drag to orbit, scroll to zoom). Describe a change in the **Goal** box
("turn it into a glowing crystal") and *all* the files are rewritten at once.

Same virtual-FS + sandboxed `<iframe srcdoc>` + **mini-bundler** pattern as the overlay:

- `<!-- include-config: scene.json -->` → `<script>window.SCENE_CONFIG = {…}</script>`
- `<!-- include-texture: texture.svg -->` → `window.SCENE_TEXTURE_SVG` (the SVG as a data URL)
- local `<script src="object.js">` (and `material.js`, `effects.js`) → inlined; the Three.js
  importmap / CDN `<script>` is left untouched

**Download** exports a real 3D-modelling file — `.glb` (binary glTF, embeds the material + the
SVG texture) or `.obj` (geometry-only, universal) — that imports straight into Blender, Maya,
Unity, or Three.js. The exporter runs inside the sandboxed preview and hands the bytes to the
page via `postMessage`, which triggers the download.

The seed project lives in `object3d/` (`preview.html`, `scene.json`, `object.js`, `material.js`,
`texture.svg`, `effects.js`); served, `object3d.html` fetches it, and via `file://` it falls
back to an embedded copy.

```bash
npx serve .      # then open http://localhost:3000/object3d.html
```

## AI-liftoff comic (`comic.html`)

A demo where the re-render actually **generates an image**. It's a comic page —
*LIFTOFF*, a cyborg (NOVA) and an emergent AI (HELIX) living through the moment of AI
liftoff — built from a multi-file project: a JSON art-direction `config.json` (shared **style**
+ **palette** + a **character bible**) and one JSON file per **panel** under `panels/`
(`span`, `shot`, `cast`, `scene`, `caption`, `dialogue`, `fx`).

Describe a change in the **Goal** box ("make it more action packed") and gptdiff rewrites the
config + panels — **adding or removing panels** as it sees fit. The harness then **organizes
every panel into one prompt** (style + character bible + each panel's scene/caption/dialogue/FX,
in reading order) and draws the **whole portrait page in a single `gpt-image-2` render** via
NanoGPT's OpenAI-compatible image endpoint — the model lays out the panels, gutters and
lettering itself:

```
POST https://nano-gpt.com/v1/images/generations
{ "model": "gpt-image-2", "prompt": <one prompt for the entire page>, "n": 1,
  "size": "1024x1536", "response_format": "b64_json" }   ──▶  { data: [{ b64_json }], cost }
```

Because the character bible is pinned into the one prompt ("keep these characters consistent in
every panel"), NOVA and HELIX stay recognizable across the page. The result is **cached per
prompt hash**, so re-running an unchanged page is free; **🎲 new take** forces a fresh sample,
and the composed prompt is shown under the page so you can see exactly what was sent.

The seed project lives in `comic/` (`config.json` + `panels/*.json`); served, `comic.html`
fetches it, and via `file://` it falls back to an embedded copy. **Export PNG** downloads the
rendered page.

> Image generation is **not free** — nothing is drawn until you click **🎨 render page** (or run
> a goal with auto-render on). Each render is **one** `gpt-image-2` call (a 1024×1536 page;
> NanoGPT returns the exact `cost`).

```bash
npx serve .      # then open http://localhost:3000/comic.html
```

## Companion — a conversation you direct (`companion.html`)

A demo where the multi-file project **is a person you talk to**, and a single gptdiff action
moves *all* of her at once. The "project" is her: `soul.md` (who she is at the core),
`mood.md` (how she feels right now), `memory.md` (what she keeps), `portrait.md` (how she
looks), `talkingto.md` (who **you** are — Mikkel, who loves open-source AI and freedom), and
`chat.md` (the visible script).

You don't type her replies — you **direct**. The action is `*continue conversation*`: hit
**▶ continue conversation** and gptdiff advances the story by exactly **one beat** across every
file — she answers in `chat.md`, `mood.md` is rewritten, a line may stick in `memory.md`, and
`portrait.md` only moves when her *appearance* visibly changes. You can also **speak as Mikkel**
(your line is appended to `chat.md`, then she responds), or hand the director a note ("she
challenges him on whether freedom scales") instead of the default beat.

`chat.md` is rendered **RPG-style**: her lines sit on the **left** with her face as the avatar,
yours sit on the **right** with no portrait, and *stage directions* drift between them as
prose — a different colour and weight, no left/right alignment — so the whole thing reads like
a scene you're steering, not a chat log.

When `portrait.md` changes (or you press **🎨 render face**), her face is drawn from that file
with **`seedream-v5.0-lite`** via NanoGPT's image endpoint, and the new face flows straight into
her chat avatar:

```
POST https://nano-gpt.com/v1/images/generations
{ "model": "seedream-v5.0-lite", "prompt": <portrait.md>, "n": 1,
  "size": "832x1216", "response_format": "b64_json" }   ──▶  { data: [{ b64_json }], cost }
```

Renders are **cached per portrait hash** (an unchanged look is free); **🎲 new take** forces a
fresh sample. The seed lives in `companion/` (the six `*.md` files); served, `companion.html`
fetches them, and via `file://` it falls back to an embedded copy.

```bash
npx serve .      # then open http://localhost:3000/companion.html
```

## Count to 100 (`count.html`)

A third demo that turns gptdiff into a **reliability loop**. There's one uneditable file —
`count` — holding a single integer. Each step the harness asks gptdiff to *add 1*, applies the
diff, and **verifies** the result is exactly the previous number plus one:

```
for (i = 0; count < 100; i++):
    diff  = generateDiff({ count }, "increment by exactly 1")
    count = Number(smartapply(diff).count)
    if count !== prev + 1:  FAIL and stop
PASS when count reaches 100
```

The loop ends three ways, each spelled out: it **passes** when it reaches 100 (every step
verified), **fails** the instant a step doesn't land on n+1 (showing what the model wrote vs.
what was expected), or **stops** when you press **Stop** — which aborts the in-flight call and
makes clear it was a user interruption, not a pass or fail. Cumulative tokens/cost and a
per-step log show what counting to 100 actually costs on the selected model.

```bash
npx serve .      # then open http://localhost:3000/count.html
```
